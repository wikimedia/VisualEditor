/**
 * Perform an action and await a callback when its side-effects are complete
 *
 * The ultimate definition of "side-effects are complete" is "when the chain of async
 * actions / setTimeout calls spawned by the action finish". This is intended to be a way
 * to wrap non-promise code in promises and have it mostly work.
 *
 * As currently implemented, we use completionTest as our sole signal. This is not
 * guaranteed to remain true. Don't write code that assumes completionTest will be
 * called, or which tests for a completely unrelated condition.
 *
 * The signature of this function is designed to let you leave signals about your intent.
 * You pass the action with side-effects in, and explain the conditions that must be met
 * for further actions to be taken.
 *
 * @param {Function} immediateAction Action to take whose status we want to track
 * @param {Function} completionTest Tests whether action is complete; ideally very cheap;
 *        there's no guarantee that we will ever call this, if we can sense completion in
 *        some other way
 * @param {number} [delayHint] Optional hint about how long to wait between tests
 * @return {jQuery.Promise} Promise that resolves when the completionTest returns true.
 *         Note that this _could_ already be resolved when it's returned, so there's no
 *         guarantee that your `done` call on it will be delayed.
