Work in progress. :)

Please see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid for some information on how
to get started with these tests and the current parser architecture.

Install dependencies and run tests:

(cd .. if you are in this README file's directory)
npm test

== Running parserTests.js ==

For parserTests, you also need MediaWiki's parser test cases (parserTests.txt). 
'npm test' from the modules directory automatically fetches the current
version to this directory. You can also specify a test case file as an
argument. You can also symlink parserTests.txt from a core git checkout.

node ./parserTests.js

Several options are available for parserTests:

node ./parserTests.js --help

Example for round-trip testing:

node ./parserTests.js --roundtrip

Enjoy!
